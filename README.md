Back in 2021, I made this for a coding assignment. Three years later, I have returned to make it worse than ever before.

CONTROLS:
~~~
1: Switch to "drag" mode
2: Switch to "line" mode
3: Switch to "circle" mode

Drag Mode:
Drag your mouse over a fish to select it
N: Name selected fish whatever is in the corresponding text field (Fish menu)
Left Click: View all named fish

Line Mode:
Left Click: Place a point. If a point is already placed, this will draw a line, which the fish can collide with, between your mouse and the other point.
X: Remove all collision objects

Circle Mode:
Left Click: Place a point. If a point is already placed, this will draw a circle with a center at the first point and a radius of the distance between your mouse and said point.
X: Remove all collision objects
